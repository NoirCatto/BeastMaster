# BeastMaster
The mod is for v1.9 version of Rain World!

Description : <br> 
Allows you to spawn a variety of creatures and items at will, in all game types including story mode and arena.

Press "B" in-game to access the spawnmenu! (Key can be re-bound through the Remix options)

Hold SHIFT to spawn a tamed creature (if possible)
Hold ALT to spawn a dead creature.

Warning!!
- Spawning some items objects from DLL menu can freeze the game, as it contains ALL the items in the game. Creatures should be fine though.
- Doesn't work with Safari mode yet, due to extensive changes that have been made to the gamemode.
***
Source code is not available, as original source code has been long lost. The current build is a decompiled v1.5 version of BeastMaster by Fyre, ported by me first to BepInEx and now to Rain World v1.9, along with some additional fixes.
